## Approach_1 

#Simple approach for SCS 3547 Group Project: Chinese Checker using Reinforcement Learning 
- This is the repository for a Chinese Checkers agent trained with heuristics-guided Reinforcement Learning and Monte Carlo Tree Search.
- Code source is from https://github.com/JayGeisler/MonteCarlo_ChineseCheckers.git

#Main_PlayGame.py
Main Code that will run the settings and the game. AI player will compete with Random player for first 10 times, then AI player with compete with 
Greedy Player for 10 times. 

#Player.py, Setting.py and Exhibit.py
Player.py contains AI Player, Random Player and Greedy Player. AI Player uses Monte Carlo simulation to predict where the most likely 
to win move is on the current board state. Random player plays randomly. Greedy player always go with position with highest value. 
Setting.py is the board of the game, will return a list of the positions of the board pieces also the value of the players positions, the values are how 
close you are to the winning side. 
Exhibit.py is designed for graph.
