# Strategy Board Game Playing Artificial Intelligence Agent

### Project by Sean Xiong, Bill Zizek, and Alexandra Yue
### SCS 3547 - Intelligent Agents & Reinforcement Learning

## Description

Herein, we've designed a Python-based program to evaluate the playing performance and strategy of various intelligent agents on different board games. Each board game has a unique configuration of a board, playing pieces,  and rules. Stemming from this, each game has a unique strategy to maximize success in winning the game. Considering the technical and time requirements of training, optimization, and other factors, we propose analyzing intelligent agents in a simple micro-environment before scaling to a larger, more complex environment. To begin with, the intelligent agent's performance will be screened using the rules and board for **Hexapawn**. Certain AI will then be selected after critical evaluation and tested using a larger and more complex playing environment in **Chinese Checkers**. 

The **objectives** of this work are two-fold:
1. Support multiple game environments (Hexapawn and Chinese Checkers)
2. Support multiple Intelligent Agents (AI) of varying degree of sophistication

# Instructions

There are two entry points for the program depending on the board game selected:  `play*.py`  and  `train*.py`.  We suggest starting with Hexapawn.

Play can then be done with a human player, computer player, or both. `train*.py` is then intended for the AI to learn by playing with itself or other AI.
