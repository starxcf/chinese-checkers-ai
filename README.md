# Chinese Checkers AI
by Sean, Bill and Alexandra

Practice Python program playing Chinese Checkers for a course project

**The Goal:** Support multiple different approaches of AI

# Detail status

The program fow now only contains working rule for Hexapawn to begin with. This game is much simpler than Chinese Checkers so that we could efficiently try out some simple algorithm before going to advanced ones.

There are two entry points for the program: `play*.py` and `train*.py`. As the name suggested, play is using the AI defined in this file to do actual play, could be either with human or computer or both. `train*.py` is for the AI to learn by playing with itself or other AI.
